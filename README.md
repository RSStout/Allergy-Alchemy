## Welcome to Allergy Alchemy

Follow along as I find exciting recipes to adapt so that they're free of allergens! When making a recipe I will provide a link to the website or I'll list which book it's from along with the page number so you can try it out yourself. If the recipe is only available in print form I won't be publishing it here because of copyright laws, but I will mention which ingredients I'm swapping out and I'll mention what I'm replacing them with.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RSStout/AllergyAlchemy/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RSStout/AllergyAlchemy/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
